# AI Profit Forecasting Tool for Digital Marketing Proposals

## 1. Project Summary
The **AI Profit Forecasting Tool** is a machine learning–powered application that predicts the potential **quarterly profit** for our company after submitting a proposal to a prospective client. By analysing past proposals, historical revenue, delivery costs, and client characteristics, the system helps the sales and management teams prioritise high-profit opportunities, set smarter pricing, and allocate resources efficiently.

## 2. Problem Statement
Currently, our sales team sends digital marketing proposals without an accurate, data-driven forecast of profitability. This can lead to:
- Overcommitting resources to low-margin clients
- Missing opportunities with high-profit potential
- Inaccurate financial planning for upcoming quarters

Without a profit forecast model, our team relies heavily on intuition, which can be biased and inconsistent.

## 3. AI-Powered Solution
I propose developing an AI-driven prediction model that:
- **Inputs:** Proposal details, client profile, industry, proposed services, estimated delivery costs, and historical deal outcomes
- **Outputs:** Predicted profit for each of the next 4 quarters (if the deal is won), along with a confidence score and the top factors influencing the prediction

**Example Workflow:**
1. Sales rep drafts a proposal and enters details into the system.
2. The model analyses the data against historical patterns.
3. The tool displays predicted quarterly profit, confidence level, and reasons for the prediction.

## 4. Technical Architecture

**Data Sources:**
- Historical proposals (value, services offered, pricing structure, discounts)
- Client information (industry, size, location)
- Historical revenue and cost breakdowns
- Win/loss status and deal timelines

**Machine Learning Pipeline:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, normalise, and anonymise client data
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract predictive features (proposal size, industry sector, cost ratio, services mix)
3. **Model Selection:** Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) or Random Forest Regression
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score
5. **Explainability Layer:** SHAP values to identify key factors driving predictions

**System Components:**
- **Backend API:** Python (FastAPI) serving the trained ML model
- **Frontend Dashboard:** React or similar for user input & displaying results
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL for storing proposals & predictions
- **Hosting:** AWS, GCP, or Azure

**Architecture Flow:**
